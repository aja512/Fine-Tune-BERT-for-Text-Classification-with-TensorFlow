# Fine-Tune-BERT-for-Text-Classification-with-TensorFlow
Fine-tuning a Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding (BERT) model for text classification with TensorFlow

* Managed the development of input pipelines. Oversaw the data tokenization and pre-processing using BERT. 
* Enhanced BERT through fine-tuning and through deployment of TensorFlow API and tf.hub.
